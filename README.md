## Features

The app features a color picker to help you find the perfect color for your
project, as well as a color storage to save your selections. Also it features a
selection of already-chosen and harmonized colors to make your work easier.

If the slightest variances don't cause you too much trouble, this tool is ideal
for you whether you're a designer, developer, or just searching for a quick way
to pick colors.

Additionally, the app is a Progressive Web App (PWA) which allows users to
access it offline. This means that even without an internet connection, you can
still access the tool.
